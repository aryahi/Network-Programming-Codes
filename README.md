# Network-Programming-Codes

Computer network programming involves writing computer programs that enable processes to communicate with each other across a computer network.

Types of connection
Connection-oriented and connectionless communications

Very generally, most of communications can be divided into connection-oriented, and connectionless. Whether a communication is a connection-oriented, or connectionless, is defined by the communication protocol, and not by API. Examples of the connection-oriented protocols include TCP and SPX, and examples of connectionless protocols include UDP, "raw IP", and IPX.

Clients and servers
The clientâ€“server model of computing is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.

For connection-oriented communications, communication parties usually have different roles. One party is usually waiting for incoming connections; this party is usually referred to as "server". Another party is the one which initiates connection; this party is usually referred to as "client".

For connectionless communications, one party ("server") is usually waiting for an incoming packet, and another party ("client") is usually understood as the one which sends an unsolicited packet to "server".
